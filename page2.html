    <h2>Full History:</h2>
    <a href="Introductory page.html">Main Page</a>
    <p>In 1834 Natalya Pushkina, his wife, met a handsome French royalist émigré in Russian service. Young d'Anthes had
        been pursuing her for two years, and eventually, his claims became so open and unabashed, that in the fall of
        1836, it led to a scandal. Pushkin challenged d'Anthes to a duel. He retracted the challenge, however, when he
        learned from rumors that d'Anthes was "really" in love with Natalya's sister, Ekaterina Goncharova. On 10
        January 1837, their marriage took place, but Pushkin refused to attend the wedding or to receive the couple in
        his home. After the marriage, d'Anthes resumed pursuing Natalya Pushkina with doubled tenacity. A duel between
        Pushkin and d'Anthes finally took place on 27 January 1837. D'Anthes fired first, and Pushkin was mortally
        wounded.</p>
