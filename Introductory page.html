            Short history:
        </p>
    </b>
    <i>
        <p>
            Alexander Pushkin(1799-1837) is considered by most to be Russia's greatest poet. Pushkin, the Russian
            national poet, is famously descended from an African slave. Pushkin's life was cut short by a duel, yet
            he was nevertheless astoundingly prolific, and his poems are as rich and complex as they are beautiful.
            In his poetry and his prose, he revolutionized Russian literature by mixing storytelling and satire with
            vernacular language.
